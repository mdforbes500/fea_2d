Created for George Mason University's Introduction to Finite Element Method elective (i.e., course number ME 499-005, Spring 2017).

## Description
2DFEM is a two-dimensional finite element algorithm written in the MATLAB language, and uses [P.O. Persson's simple mesh generator](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/). Solves linear domain problems with adaptive meshing in heat transfer, fluid flow, and stress-strain problems.

Based upon earlier work on a one-dimensional paper concieved of in the first two months, which can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PkRTe-dsb8tez-xSmyVZE1mPyTBQJknpR_gKeBGPHo/edit?usp=sharing). The final project presentation is given [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10wBdogPJ4topZocab_FyhOpC3kaU7Q1SFaOQyjPiGUM/edit?usp=sharing), while the whitepaper is archived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qrWrv--FMSphUA_i7E1tVV_HrJUCRYyoqkgmajY0WuY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage
2DFEM is a GNU project, and may be used in other projects as long as appropriate attribution is cited to the developers: Malcolm D. Forbes and Je Park. Thank you and happy meshing!
